# Uniview Assets Library
## A database of Uniview Assets.
This database will ultimately be based off of a .csv file.   
The custom_modules.csv file will be converted into a Javascript array of objects, and formatted into a table. By using the [DataTables] (https://datatables.net/) Plugin for JQuery, the resulting table will be searchable.  

## Future Features: 
(Hoo boy there's a lot):
- Data entry can be done within Excel to speed things up
- CAUTION: the csv file must always be saved as a csv file. 
- Clean up the file structure: right now, the files are jumbled up into the html file. This must be corrected.
- Build test cases (missing values, undefined, large values, missing columns, etc.)  
- Make it pretty (CSS code, right now this is dependent on the css code recommended by the DataTables Plugin).   
- Add a Javascript form to the page so that users can enter data for new assets. 
- Data Entry for the actual csv base file. 

## Technologies Used:
